 *
 * Application that displays a slide show. Touch right half of the
 * screen to go to the next slide, touch left half to go to the previous
 * slide.
 *
 * To keep this example simple, no scaling of the images is currently done.
 *
 * The actual slides used in the example was done for a GTUG presentation
 * in Stockholm, in February 10, 2011, and are now a bit out-dated. The
 * SlideShow app developed for that presentation was programmed in Lua. :)
 *
 * This example shows how to use a simple caching mechanism to load
 * and unload images, in order to prevent out-of-memory problems.
 *
 * On Android, the bitmap memory that can be used by an application
 * is limited. If you have too many/too big bitmaps you get the error:
 *
 *   java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: bitmap size exceeds VM budget
 *
 * Note that there are 24 images in the slide show, but only 6 unique
 * images. The images will be shown repeatedly. The reuse of the images
 * is just a way of stressing the memory limit (24 unloaded binary
 * resources will be allocated).
 *
 * If you inspect the log (adb logcat on Android), you can see how
 * images get loaded and unloaded as you move through the slides.
 *
 * The .ubin resource type does not load the resource into memory when
 * the application starts, but keeps them "on disk" in an unloaded state.
 * Whenever there is a syscall that takes a handle to a ubin resource
 * as a parameter, the data is read from disk and an object is created
 * in memory using that data (like an image). You then call maDestoryObject
 * to free the allocated object (for example an image). The resource is
 * still on disk, and therefore if can again be used to create a new object.
 * This is the way the caching mechanism used in this program works.
 *
 * Resource ids (handle values) start at 1, and in this program we
 * never refer to resource by name, but by the sequence number (index).
 * If you want to add other resources to the program, you can add them at
 * the end of the resource file, and refer to them by name. In that case
 * you need to include the resource definitions like this:
 *
 *   #include "MAHeaders.h"
 *
 * Happy hacking! :)
